Queen Cassiopeia boasted that she and her daughter were more beautiful than the Nereids, the sea-nymph attendants of the sea god Poseidon and the sea goddess Thetis. Some stories say that both Thetis and Amphitrite, who was the wife of the sea god Poseidon (and in some places considered an alternate sea goddess) were also Nereids. This meant that Cassiopeia had insulted the gods with her boasted. The Nereids begged Poseidon to punish Cassiopeia. Poseidon sent flood waters carrying a sea monster (in some versions named Cetus) to destroy the kingdom.\nAn oracle told Cepheus that the only way to appease Poseidon and save the kingdom was to sacrifice Andromeda to the monster. Andromeda was chained to a seaside cliff to be eaten by the monster. Perseus, a son of Zeus and a mortal mother, was on his way home from carrying out his pledge to destroy the Medusa. He saw Andromeda in peril and instantly fell in love with her.\nHe offered to destroy the monster, rescue Andromeda, and save the kingdom in return for her hand in marriage. Cepheus and Cassiopeia agreed reluctantly (having already promised her to someone else). Perseus killed the monster and freed the princess.\nAndromeda insists on keeping the promise made by her parents and married Perseus. As a reward, the goddess Athena (who had been helping Perseus to defeat the Medusa) placed an image of Andromeda in the stars.\nThe basic constellation is in the shape of an \"A\" with a star representing Andromeda\'s head at the point of the \"A\". Some versions are more elaborate, tracing her outspread arms chained to the cliff.'),('Apu','Apus','Apus',206.0,'Petrus Plancius','1598-1603','constellar/constellation/apus.jpg','Apus was one of twelve constellations published by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the Eerste Schipvaart, to the East Indies. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog in 1603 under the Dutch name De Paradijs Voghel, \"The Bird of Paradise\", and Plancius called the constellation Paradysvogel Apis Indica; the first word is Dutch for \"bird of paradise\". Apis (Latin for \"bee\") is assumed to have been a typographical error for avis (\"bird\").\nAfter its introduction on Plancius\'s globe, the constellation\'s first known appearance in a celestial atlas was in German cartographer Johann Bayer\'s Uranometria of 1603. Bayer called it Apis Indica while fellow astronomers Johannes Kepler and his son-in-law Jakob Bartsch called it Apus or Avis Indica. The name Apus is derived from the Greek apous, meaning \"without feet\". This referred to the Western misconception that the bird-of-paradise had no feet, which arose because the only specimens available in the West had feet and wings removed. Such specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of Ferdinand Magellan\'s expedition brought them home. The constellation later lost some of its tail when Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille used those stars to establish Octans in the 1750s.'),('Aqu','Aquila','vultur volans',652.0,'Eudoxus and Aratus','4th century BC - 3rd century BC ','constellar/constellation/aquila.jpg','Aquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy. It was mentioned earlier by Eudoxus in the fourth century BC and Aratus in the third century BC.\nIt is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. The constellation was also known as Vultur volans (the flying vulture) to the Romans, not to be confused with Vultur cadens which was their name for Lyra. It is often held to represent the eagle which held Zeus\'s/Jupiter\'s thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology. Aquila is also associated with the eagle that kidnapped Ganymede, a son of one of the kings of Troy (associated with Aquarius), to Mount Olympus to serve as cup-bearer to the gods.\nPtolemy catalogd 19 stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of Antinous, which was named in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117–138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to Tycho Brahe, who catalogd 12 stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. Hevelius determined 23 stars in the first and 19 in the second.\nThe Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle, but is sometimes mistakenly thought as a seagull which is located in the same area as the Greek constellation.'),('Ori','Orion','Orion',594.0,'Greek','Greek antiquity','constellar/constellation/orion.jpg','The story behind the name: The pattern in the constellation Orion was recognized as a human figure by many ancient cultures. Orion\'s position on the Celestial Equator makes it visible all over our planet.\nAncient Indians saw the figure as a king who had been shot by an arrow (represented by the stars in Orion\'s belt). Ancient Egyptians thought the stars in the belt represented the resting place of the soul of the god Osiris. The Arabs saw the constellation as the figure of a giant.\nThe constellation takes its name from the Greek stories about Orion, a legendary hunter. The stories about Orion are only loosely connected and exist in several variants. Some are thought to be derived from earlier stories from more ancient cultures. One myth says that Orion was banished to the sky for boasting about how many animals he would kill (to impress Eos). He and his hunting dogs, Canis Major and Minor, chase the constellations represent animals, but can never catch them.\nThere are two legends about Orion\'s birth, both relating him to water. In one, he is the son of Poseidon and Eurayle, one of the three daughters of Ceto and Phorcys. In the other, he is the son of the widowed bee-keeper Hyrieus, conceived from a sacrifice to the gods that may be related to an ancient African rain-making charm. In this story he was named Urion, \"maker of water\". His birth legends may be connected to the seasonal rains that come near the rising and setting of the constellation.'),('Aur','Auriga','Charioteer',657.0,'Plotemy','2nd - century','constellar/constellation/auriga.jpg','The first record of Auriga\'s stars was in Mesopotamia as a constellation called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, this may have represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of the stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represents one animal. The stars of Auriga includes an association herd of goats, also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.\nIn Greek mythology, Auriga is often identified as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be the inventor of the quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created in the image of the Sun\'s chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.\nAuriga, however, is sometimes described as Myrtilus, who was Hermes\'s son and the charioteer of Oenomaus. The association of Auriga and Myrtilus is supported by depictions of the constellation, which rarely shows a chariot. Myrtilus\'s chariot was destroyed in a race intended for suitors to win the heart of Oenomaus\'s daughter Hippodamia. Myrtilus earned his position in the sky when Hippodamia\'s successful suitor, Pelops, killed him, despite his complicity in helping Pelops win her hand. After his death, Myrtilus\' father Hermes placed him in the sky. Yet another mythological association of Auriga is Theseus\'s son Hippolytus. He was ejected from Athens after he refused the romantic advances of his stepmother Phaedra, who committed suicide as a result. He was killed when his chariot was wrecked, but revived by Asclepius.'),('Cae','Caelum','Chisel',125.0,'Nicolas Louis de Lacaille','1754.0','constellar/constellation/caelum.jpg','Caelum was incepted as one of fourteen southern constellations in the 18th century by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, a French astronomer and celebrated of the Age of Enlightenment. It speakers its name Burin among its names, latinized in his catalog of 1763 as Caelum Sculptoris (“Engraver\'s Chisel”).\nFrancis Baily shortened this name to Caelum, as suggested by John Herschel. In Lacaille\'s original chart, it was shown as a pair of engraver\'s tools: a standard burin and more specific shape-forming échoppe tied by a ribbon, but came to be ascribed a simple chisel. Johann Elert Bode stated the name as plural with a singular possessor, Caela Scalptoris – in German (die ) Grabstichel (“the Engraver’s Chisels”) – but this did not stick.\nThese stars avoid being engulfed by daylight for some of every day (when above the horizon) to viewers in mid- and well-inhabited higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. Caelum shares with (to the north) Taurus, Eridanus and Orion midnight culmination in December (high summer), resulting in this fact. In winter (such as June) the constellation can be observed adequately inset from the horizons during its rising before dawn and/or setting after dusk as it culminates then at around mid-day, well above the sun. In South Africa, Argentina, their sub-tropical neighboring areas and some of Australia in high June the key stars may be traced before dawn in the east; near the equator the stars lose night potential in May to June; they ill-compete with the Sun in northern tropics and sub-tropics from late February to mid-September with March being unsuitable as to post-sunset due to the light of the Milky Way.'),('Cam','Camelopardalis','Giraffe',757.0,'Petrus Plancius','1613','constellar/constellation/camelopardalis.jpg','Camelopardalis is not one of Ptolemy\'s 48 constellations in the Almagest. It was created by Petrus Plancius in 1613.It first appeared in a globe designed by him and produced by Pieter van den Keere. One year later, Jakob Bartsch featured it in his atlas. Johannes Hevelius depicts this constellation in his works which were so influential that it was referred to as Camelopardali Hevelii or abbreviated as Camelopard. Hevel.\nPart of the constellation was hived off to form the constellation Sciurus Volans, the Flying Squirrel, by William Croswell in 1810. However this was not taken up by later cartographers.'),('Can','Canes Venatici','Hunting dog',465.0,'Johannes Hevelius','1687.0','constellar/constellation/canesvenatici.jpg','The stars of Canes Venatici are not bright. In classical times, they were listed by Ptolemy as unfigured stars below the constellation Ursa Major in his star catalog.\nIn medieval times, the identification of these stars with the dogs of Boötes arose through a mistranslation: some of Boötes\' stars were wonderfully described as representing the club (Greek: κολλοροβος, kollorobos) of Boötes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemy\'s Almagest was translated from Greek to Arabic, the translator Hunayn ibn Ishaq did not know the Greek word and rendered it as a similar-sounding compound Arabic word for a kind of weapon, writing العصا ذات الكُلاب al-\'aşā dhāt al-kullāb, which means \'the staff having a hook\'.\nWhen the Arabic text was later translated into Latin, the translator, Gerard of Cremona, mistook كُلاب kullāb (\'hook\') for كِلاب kilāb (\'dogs\'). Both written words look the same in Arabic text without diacritics, leading Gerard to write it as Hastile habens canes (\'spearshaft-having dogs\'). In 1533, the German astronomer Peter Apian depicted Boötes as having two dogs with him.\nThese spurious dogs floated about the astronomical literature until Hevelius decided to make them a separate constellation in 1687. Hevelius chose the name Asterion[a] for the northern dog and Chara[b] for the southern dog, as Canes Venatici, \'the hunting dogs \', in his star atlas.\nIn his star catalog, the Czech astronomer Antonín Bečvář assigned the names Asterion to β CVn and Chara to α CVn.\nAlthough the International Astronomical Union dropped several constellations in 1930 that were medieval and Renaissance innovations, Canes Venatici survived to become one of the 88 IAU designated constellations.'),('Hyd','Hydrus','Male water snake',243.0,'Petrus Plancius','1597 - 1598 ','constellar/constellation/hydrus.jpg','Hydrus was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the Eerste Schipvaart, to the East Indies. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in late 1597 (or early 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer\'s Uranometria of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name De Waterslang, \"The Water Snake\", it representing a type of snake encountered on the expedition rather than a mythical creature. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille called it l’Hydre Mâle on the 1756 version of his planisphere of the southern skies, distinguishing it from the feminine Hydra. The French name was retained by Jean Fortin in 1776 for his Atlas Céleste, while Lacaille Latinised the name to Hydrus for his revised Coelum Australe Stelliferum in 1763.'),('Cas','Cassiopeia','Cassiopeia queen',598.0,'Greek','Greek antiquity','constellar/constellation/cassiopeia.jpg','The constellation is named after Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia. Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia] and mother of Princess Andromeda. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed next to each other among the stars, along with Andromeda. She was placed in the sky as a punishment after enraging Poseidon with the boast that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids or, alternatively, that she herself was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. She was forced to wheel around the north celestial pole on her throne, spending half of her time clinging to it so she does not fall off, and Poseidon decreed that Andromeda should be bound to a rock as prey for the monster Cetus. Andromeda was then rescued by the hero Perseus, whom she later married.\nCassiopeia has been variously portrayed throughout her history as a constellation. In Persia, she was drawn by al-Sufi as a queen holding a staff with a crescent moon in her right hand, wearing a crown, as well as a two-humped camel. In France, she was portrayed as having a marble throne and a palm leaf in her left hand, holding her robe in her right hand. This depiction is from Augustin Royer\'s 1679 atlas.'),('Wat','Hydra','Water snake',1303.0,'Plotemy','2nd - century','constellar/constellation/hydra.jpg','The Greek constellation of Hydra is an adaptation of a Babylonian constellation: the MUL.APIN includes a \"serpent\" constellation (MUL.DINGIR.MUŠ) that loosely corresponds to Hydra. It is one of two Babylonian \"serpent\" constellations (the other being the origin of the Greek Serpens), a mythological hybrid of serpent, lion and bird. The shape of Hydra resembles a twisting snake, and features as such in some Greek myths. One myth associates it with a water snake that a crow served Apollo in a cup when it was sent to fetch water; Apollo saw through the fraud, and angrily cast the crow, cup, and snake, into the sky. It is also associated with the monster Hydra, with its many heads, killed by Hercules, represented in another constellation. According to legend, if one of the Hydra\'s heads was cut off, two more would grow in its place. However, Hercules\' nephew, Iolaus, searched the necks with a torch to prevent them from growing back and thus enabled Hercules to overcome the Hydra.'),('Eri','Eridanus','River',1138.0,'Plotemy','2nd - century','constellar/constellation/eridanus.jpg','The story behind the name: Starting at the foot of Orion, the constellation Eridanaus (a river), winds it way southward to its brightest star, Achernar. Eridanus has been associated with rivers in ancient cultures of Greece, Babylon, Egypt, and Asia. It was considered by Homer to be the \"ocean stream,\" and other Greek myths portrayed these stars as the river that flowed from Aquarius. Eridanus is one of Ptomely\'s 48 original constellations. The most southern and brightest star of the constellation, Achernar, was added in the Renaissance times.\nThe best known myth associated with Eridanus is the rise and fall of Phaeton, son of Helios the Sun god (Apollo). Helios\'s task as a god was to take the reins of a chariot lead by white horses and traverse the heavens above earth. Phaeton, encouraging by his sisters, restlessly begged his father for the opportunity to drive the chariot. Helios turned down Phaeton many times because he feared that his son was not strong enough to control the chariot. One day Helios gave in to his son\'s requests and let Phaeton take the reins. As Phaeton rose into the sky with the chariot, he drove the chariot erratically, nearly freezing and burning the Earth\'s surface. Zeus was not amused by Phaeton\'s adventure and struck him down with a bolt of lightning. Phaeton fell off the chariot and met his end as he tumbled into the sacred river Eridanus. The ancient Greeks believed that the constellation represented the haphazard path Phaeton traveled.'),('Cep','Cepheus','Fairy king',588.0,'Plotemy','2nd - century','constellar/constellation/cepheus.jpg','Cepheus is a constellation in the far northern sky, named after Cepheus, a king of Aethiopia in Greek mythology. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the second century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 constellations in the modern times.\nThe constellation\'s brightest star is Alpha Cephei, with an apparent magnitude of 2.5. Delta Cephei is the prototype of an important class of star known as a Cepheid variable. RW Cephei, an orange hypergiant, together with the red supergiants Mu Cephei, MY Cephei, SW Cephei, VV Cephei, and V354 Cephei are among the largest stars known. In addition, Cepheus also has the hyperluminous quasar S5 0014+81, which hosts an ultramassive black hole in its core, reported at 40 billion solar masses, about 10,000 times more massive than the central black hole of the Milky Way, making this among the most massive black holes currently known.\nCepheus was the King of Aethiopia. He was married to Cassiopeia and was the father of Andromeda, both of whom are immortalized as modern day constellations along with Cepheus.'),('Dra','Draco','Dragon',1083.0,'Plotemy','2nd - century','constellar/constellation/draco.jpg','Two circumstances lie behind the multitude of myths associated with Draco. First, due to the precession of the Earth, Draco\'s star Thuban was the pole star approximately 4000 years ago. It would have seemed to ancient sky watchers that the Earth revolved around Draco. Second, dragons and other large, powerful creatures were frequently associated with early creation myths. In many stories, the gods had terrible battles with monsters which they destroyed and flung into the skies, from whom they ripped control of the Earth, or from whose remains or corpse the Earth was born.\nOne such myth was the Babylonian creation story of Tiamat who turned herself into a dragon, but was defeated and split into two, one half becoming the heavens, the other half the Earth. A very early Greek creation myth shows the implications of this story.\nIn a Norse creation myth, a dragon gnaws at the roots of Ygdrasil, the tree that covers the world.\nThe Egyptians saw Draco as a hippopotamus or crocodile, representing gods and goddesses who appeared in the forms of those animals.\nGreek and Roman mythology have many legends about dragons and serpents, but two especially are connected with Draco. One story is Zeus\'s battle against his father, the Titan Cronus. It had been prophesied that one of his own sons would dethrone him, so each time his wife Rhea bore a child, Cronus swallowed it. Rhea hid the infant Zeus and tricked Cronus into swallowing a stone. He uncovered the trick and went after Zeus who escaped by turning himself into a serpent and his nurses into bears. The constellations Draco and Ursa Major and Minor commemorate his escape.\nAnother legend is the eleventh labor of Hercules. Hercules was asked to obtain fruit from the golden apple tree, a wedding gift from Gaia, that was planted in Hera\'s garden and guarded by the dragon Ladon. In accomplishing the task, Hercules killed the dragon. Hera wept for Ladon and set his image in the stars.'),('Dru','Grus','Crane',366.0,'Petrus Plancius','1598','constellar/constellation/grus.jpg','The stars that form Grus were originally considered part of the neighboring constellation Piscis Austrinus (the southern fish), with Gamma Gruis seen as part of the fish\'s tail. The stars were first defined as a separate constellation by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius, who created twelve new constellations based on the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition , known as the Eerste Schipvaart, to the East Indies. Grus first appeared on a 35-centimetre-diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. Its first depiction in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer\'s Uranometria of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name Den Reygher, \"The Heron\", but Bayer followed Plancius and Hondius in using Grus.\nAn alternative name for the constellation, Phoenicopterus (Latin \"flamingo\"), was briefly used during the early 17th century, seen in the 1605 work Cosmographiae Generalis by Paul Merula of Leiden University and a c. 1625 globe by Dutch globe maker Pieter van den Keere. Astronomer Ian Ridpath has reported the symbolism likely came from Plancius originally, who had worked with both of these people.Grus and the nearby constellations Phoenix, Tucana and Pavo are collectively called the \"Southern Birds\".\nThe stars that correspond to Grus were generally too far south to be seen from China. In Chinese astronomy, Gamma and Lambda Gruis may have been included in the tub-shaped asterism Baijiù, along with stars from Piscis Austrinus. In Central Australia, the Arrernte and Luritja people living on a mission in Hermannsburg viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. Alpha and Beta Gruis, along with Fomalhaut, Alpha Pavonis and the stars of Musca, were all claimed by the Arrernte.'),('Cir','Circinus','compasss',93.0,'Nicolas Louis de Lacaille','1756','constellar/constellation/circinus.jpg','Circinus is a small, faint constellation in the southern sky, first defined in 1756 by the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. Its name is Latin for compass, referring to the drafting tool used for drawing circles (it should not be confused with Pyxis, a constellation that represents a mariner\'s compass which points north). Its brightest star is Alpha Circini, with an apparent magnitude of 3.19. Slightly variable, it is the brightest rapidly oscillating Ap star in the night sky. AX Circini is a Cepheid variable visible with the unaided eye, and BX Circini is a faint star thought to have been formed from the merger of two white dwarfs. Two sun-like stars have planetary systems: HD 134060 has two small planets, and HD 129445 has a Jupiter-like planet. Supernova SN 185 appeared in Circinus in 185 AD and was recorded by Chinese observers. Two novae have been observed more recently, in the 20th century.\nThe Milky Way runs through the constellation, featuring objects such as the open cluster prominent NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts a notable spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, discovered in 1977; it is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way. The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.\nIn 1756, French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille introduced the constellation of Circinus with the French name le Compas, representing a pair of dividing compasses, on a chart of the southern sky.On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor\'s level in a set of draftsman\'s instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.');

It was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars, and has remained a constellation since ancient times; it now includes the ancient pattern and the surrounding stars.In the description of the Babylonian zodiac given in the clay tablets known as the MUL.APIN, the constellation, now known as Aries, was the final station along the ecliptic. The MUL.APIN was a comprehensive table of the rising and settings of stars, which likely served as an agricultural calendar. Modern-day Aries was known as MULLÚ.ḪUN.GÁ, \"The Agrarian Worker\" or \"The Hired Man\". Although likely compiled in the 12th or 11th century BC, the MUL.APIN reflects a tradition that marks the Pleiades as the vernal equinox, which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. The earliest identifying reference to Aries as a distinct constellation comes from the boundary stones that date from 1350 to 1000 BC. On several boundary stones, a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters. The shift in identification from the constellation as the Agrarian Worker to the Ram likely occurred in later Babylonian tradition because of its growing association with Dumuzi the Shepherd. By the time the MUL.APIN was created—in 1000 BC—modern Aries was identified with both Dumuzi\'s ram and a hired laborer. The exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of Aries or other ram figures.'),('Taurus','♉︎','Bull','April 20 – May 21','Earth','constellar/zodiac/taurus.jpg','The identification of the constellation of Taurus with a bull is very old, certainly dating to the Chalcolithic, and perhaps even to the Upper Paleolithic. Michael Rappenglück of the University of Munich cave that Taurus is represented in a painting at the Hall of the Bulls in the caves at Lascaux (dated to roughly 15,000 BC), which he is accompanied by a depiction of the Pleiades.The name \" seven sisters\" has been used for the Pleiades in the languages of many cultures, including indigenous groups of Australia, North America and Siberia. This suggests that the name may have a common ancient origin.\nTaurus marked the point of vernal (spring) equinox in the Chalcolithic and the Early Bronze Age, from about 4000 BC to 1700 BC, after which it moved into the neighboring constellation Aries.The Pleiades were closest to the Sun at vernal equinox around the 23rd century BC. In Babylonian astronomy, the constellation was listed in the MUL.APIN as GU4.AN.NA, \"The Bull of Heaven\". Although it has been claimed that \"when the Babylonians first set up their zodiac, the vernal equinox lay in Taurus,\"there is a claim that the MUL.APIN tablets indicate that the vernal equinox was marked by the Babylonian constellation known as \"the hired man\" (the modern Aries).'),('Gemini','♊︎','Twins','May 21 – June 21','Air ','constellar/zodiac/gemini.jpg','In Babylonian astronomy, the stars Castor and Pollux were known as the Great Twins.

Both names can be understood as titles of Nergal, the major Babylonian god of plague and pestilence, who was king of the Underworld.\nIn Greek mythology, Gemini was associated with the myth of Castor and Pollux, the children of Leda and Argonauts both. Pollux was the son of Zeus, who seduced Leda, while Castor was the son of Tyndareus, king of Sparta and Leda\'s husband. Castor and Pollux were also mythologically associated with St. Elmo\'s fire in their role as the protectors of sailors.When Castor died, because he was mortal, Pollux begged his father Zeus to give Castor immortality, and he did, by uniting them together in the heavens.'),('Cancer','♋︎','Crab','June 21 – July 23','Water','constellar/zodiac/cancer.jpg','Cancer was the backdrop to the Sun\'s most northerly position in the sky (the summer solstice) in ancient times, when the Earth\'s Sun-facing side was maximally tilted towards the south, in the Gregorian calendar kept within a few days of June 21. Equivalently , this is the date when the Sun is directly overhead as far north as 23.437° N. The northern-most parallel where the sun is directly overhead is still called the Tropic of Cancer, even though the corresponding position on the sky now occurs in Taurus , due to the precession of the equinoxes.\nThe close conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 1563 – which was observed by Tycho Brahe and led him to note the inaccuracy of existing ephemerides and to begin his own program of astronomical measurements – occurred in Cancer not far from Praesepe.\nIn Greek mythology, Cancer is identified with the crab that appeared while Heracles fought the many-headed Lernaean Hydra. Hercules slew the crab after it bit him in the foot. Afterwards, the goddess Hera, an enemy of Heracles, placed the crab among the stars.'),('Leo','♌︎','Lion','July 23 – August 23','fire','constellar/zodiac/leo.jpg','Leo was one of the earliest recognized constellations, with archaeological evidence that the Mesopotamians had a similar constellation as early as 4000 BCE.[10] The Persians called Leo Ser or Shir; the Turks, Artan; the Syrians, Aryo; the Jews, Arye; the Indians, Simha, all meaning \"lion\".\nGreek stamp depicting a mosaical image of the encounter between Hercules and Leo, the Nemean Lion\nSome mythologists believe that in Sumeria, Leo represented the monster Humbaba, who was killed by Gilgamesh.\nIn Babylonian astronomy, the constellation was called UR.GU.LA, the \"Great Lion\"; the bright star Regulus was known as \"the star that stands at the Lion\'s breast.\" Regulus also had distinctly regal associations, as it was known as the King Star.\nIn Greek mythology, Leo was identified as the Nemean Lion which was killed by Heracles (Hercules to the Romans) during the first of his twelve labors.[10][8] The Nemean Lion would take women as hostages to its lair in a cave, luring warriors from nearby towns to save the damsel in distress, to their misfortune.The Lion was impervious to any weapon; thus, the warriors\' clubs, swords, and spears were rendered useless against it. Realizing that he must defeat the Lion with his bare hands, Hercules slipped into the Lion\'s cave and engaged it at close quarters. When the Lion pounced, Hercules caught it in midair, one hand grasping the Lion\'s forelegs and the other its hind legs, and bent it backwards, breaking its back and freeing the trapped maidens. Zeus commemorated this labor by placing the Lion in the sky.'),('Virgo','♍︎','Maiden','August 23 – September','Earth','constellar/zodiac/virgo.jpg','n the Babylonian MUL.APIN (c. 10th century BC), part of this constellation was known as \"The Furrow\", representing the goddess Shala and her ear of grain. One star in this constellation, Spica, this tradition as it is Latin for \"ear of grain\", one of the major products of the Mesopotamian furrow. For this reason the constellation became associated with fertility. The constellation of Virgo in Hipparchus corresponds to two Babylonian constellations: the \"Furrow\" in the eastern sector of Virgo and the \"Frond of Erua\" in the western sector. The Frond of Erua was depicted as a goddess holding a palm-frond – a motif that still occasionally appears in much later depictions of Virgo.\nEarly Greek astronomy associated the Babylonian constellation with their goddess of wheat and agriculture, Demeter. The Romans associated it with their goddess Ceres. alternatively, the constellation was sometimes identified as the virgin goddess Iustitia or Astraea, holding the scales of justice in her hand (that now are separated as the constellation Libra). Another Greek myth later, Classical times, relevant Virgo as Erigone, the daughter of Icarius of Athens. Icarius, who had been favored by Dionysus and was killed by his shepherds while they were intoxicated after which Erigone hanged herself in grief; in versions of this myth, Dionysus is said to have placed the father and daughter in the stars as Boötes and Virgo respectively. Another figure who is associated with the constellation Virgo was the spring goddess Persephone,] the daughter of Zeus and Demeter who had married Hades and resided in the Underworld during summer.'),('Libra','♎︎','Scales','September 23 – October','Air ','constellar/zodiac/libra.jpg','Libra was known in Babylonian astronomy as MUL Zibanu (the \"scales\" or \"balance\"), or alternatively as the Claws of the Scorpion. The scales were held sacred to the sun god Shamash, who was also the patron of truth and justice.\nIt was also seen as the Scorpion\'s Claws in ancient Greece. Since these times, Libra has been associated with law, fairness and civility. In Arabic zubānā means \"scorpion\'s claws\", and likely in other Semitic languages: this resembles of words may be why the Scorpion\'s claws became the Scales. Indeed, Zubenelgenubi and Zubeneschamali, the names of the constellation\'s two main stars, in Arabic mean \"southern claw\" and \"northern claw\" respectively. It has also been suggested that the scales are an allusion to the fact that when the sun entered this part of the ecliptic at the autumnal equinox, the days and nights are equal. Libra\'s status as the location of the equinox earned the equinox the name \"First Point of Libra\", though this location ceased to coincide with the constellation in 730 BC because of the precession of the equinoxes.\nIn ancient Egypt the three brightest stars of Libra (α, β, and σ Librae) formed a constellation that was viewed as a boat. Libra is a constellation not mentioned by Eudoxus or Aratus. Libra is mentioned by Manetho (3rd century B.C.) and Geminus (1st century B.C.), and included by Ptolemy in his 48 asterisms. Ptolemy catalogd 17 stars, Tycho Brahe 10, and Johannes Hevelius 20.[6] It only became a constellation in ancient Rome, when it began to represent the scales held by Astraea, the goddess of justice, associated with Virgo in the Greek mythology.'),('Scorpio','♏︎','Scorpion','October 23 – November','Water','constellar/zodiac/scorpio.jpg','Scorpius, (Latin: “Scorpion”) also called Scorpio, in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying in the southern sky between Libra and Sagittarius, at about 16 hours 30 minutes right ascension and 30° south declination. Its brightest star, Antares (Alpha Scorpii), the 15th brightest star in the sky, has a magnitude of 1.1. Its name comes from the Greek for “rival of Ares” (i.e., rival of the planet Mars) and was probably given because of the star’s red color and brightness. The brightest X-ray source in the sky, Scorpius X-1, is found in this constellation.\nIn astrology, Scorpius (or Scorpio) is the eighth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about October 24 to about November 21. Its representation as a scorpion is related to the Greek legend of the scorpion that stung Orion to death ( said to be why Orion sets as Scorpius rises in the sky). Another Greek myth relates that a scorpion caused the horses of the Sun to bolt when they were being driven for a day by the inexperienced youth Phaeton.\nIn Greek mythology, several myths associated with Scorpius attribute it to Orion. According to one version, Orion boasted to the goddess Artemis and her mother, Leto, that he would kill every animal on Earth. Artemis and Leto sent a scorpion to kill Orion. Their battle caught the attention of Zeus, who raised both combatants to the sky to serve as a reminder for mortals to curb their excessive pride. In another version of the myth, Artemis\' twin brother, Apollo, was the one who sent the scorpion to kill Orion after the hunter earned the goddess\' favor by admitting she was better than him. After Zeus raised Orion and the scorpion to the sky, the former hunts every winter but flees every summer when the scorpion comes. In both versions, Artemis asked Zeus to raise Orion.\nIn a Greek myth without Orion, the celestial scorpion encountered Phaethon while he was driving his father Helios\' Sun Chariot.'),('Sagittarius','♐︎','(Centaur) Archer','November 22 – December 22','fire','constellar/zodiac/sagittarius.jpg','the constellations that are included in the Zodiac - the 12 constellations recognized by Babylonian astronomers through which our Sun, moon, and planets appeared to travel during the course of a year - are considered to be among the oldest sky patterns recognized by human civilizations. They were thought to have more significance because they were touched by the Sun. In Greek mythology, Sagittarius is commonly thought to represent a centaur, a war-like creature with the torso of a man and the body of a horse. Sagittarius is most often associated with Crotus, the son of Pan (the goat-god) and Eupheme (the Muses\' nurse). Crotus, who was raised by the Muses, became a skilled hunter who also absorbed a love of the arts from the Muses.\nThe Muses begged Zeus to honor him with a constellation.\nThe constellation was also known to earlier civilizations in the Middle East. Several civilizations in the Mesopotamian area associated the constellation with their god of war, variants of the archer-god Nergal. The Arabs named a number of prominent stars in the constellation after parts of a human body and parts of a bow and arrow, indicating that they too associated this constellation with an archer.'),('Capricorn','♑︎','Mountain Goat or \"Goat-horned\" Sea-Goat','December 22 – January','Earth','constellar/zodiac/aries.jpg','The constellation was first attested in depictions on a cylinder-seal from around the 21st century BCE, it was explicitly recorded in the Babylonian star catalogs before 1000 BCE. In the Early Bronze Age the winter solstice occurred in the constellation, but due to the precession of the equinoxes, the December solstice now takes place in the constellation Sagittarius. The Sun is now in the constellation Capricorn (as distinct from the astrological sign) from late January through mid-February.\nAlthough the solstice during the northern hemisphere\'s winter no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus, as it did until 130 BCE, the astrological sign called Capricorn is still used to denote the position of the solstice, and the latitude of the sun\'s most southerly position continues to be called the Tropic of Capricorn, a term which also applies to the line on the Earth at which the sun is directly overhead at local noon on the day of the December solstice.\nThe planet Neptune was discovered by German astronomer Johann Galle, near Deneb Algedi (δ Capricorni) on 23 September 1846, as Capricornus can be seen best from Europe at 4:00am in September (although, by modern constellation boundaries established in the early 20th century CE, Neptune lay within the confines of Aquarius at the time of its discovery).'),('Aquarius','♒︎','Water-Bearer','January 20 – February','air sign','constellar/zodiac/aquarius.jpg','Aquarius is identified as GU.LA \"The Great One\" in the Babylonian star catalogs and represents the god Ea himself, who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase. The Babylonian star-figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium. It contained the winter solstice in the Early Bronze Age.\nIn Old Babylonian astronomy, Ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the Sun\'s path, the \"Way of Ea\", respectively to the period of 45 days on either side of winter solstice. Aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the Babylonians regularly experienced, and thus was negative connoted. In Ancient Egypt astronomy, Aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the Nile; the banks were said to flood when Aquarius put his jar into the river, beginning spring.\nIn the Greek tradition, the constellation came to be represented simply as a single vase from which a stream poured down to Piscis Austrinus. The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha \"water-pitcher\".\nIn Greek mythology, Aquarius is sometimes associated with Deucalion, the son of Prometheus who built a ship with his wife Pyrrha to survive an imminent flood. They sailed for nine days before washing ashore on Mount Parnassus. Aquarius is also sometimes identified with beautiful Ganymede, a youth in Greek mythology and the son of Trojan king Tros, who was taken to Mount Olympus by Zeus to act as cup-carrier to the gods. Neighboring Aquila represents the eagle, under Zeus\' command, that snatched the young boy;[9] some versions of the myth indicate that the eagle was in fact Zeus transformed. An alternative version of the tale recounts Ganymede\'s kidnapping by the goddess of the dawn, Eos, motivated by her affection for young men; Zeus then stole him from Eos and employed him as cup-bearer. Yet another figure associated with the water bearer is Cecrops I, a king of Athens who sacrificed water instead of wine to the gods.'),('Pisces','♓︎','Fish','February 18 – March 20','Water','constellar/zodiac/pisces.jpg','Pisces constellation is of Babylonian origin. The Babylonians saw it as a pair of fish joined by a cord. The constellation is usually associated with the Roman myth of Venus and Cupid, who tied themselves with a rope and transformed into fish to escape the monster Typhon. The star Alpha Piscium, also known by the traditional name Alrescha (“the cord” in Arabic) marks the knot of the rope.\nThe constellation is associated with a similar story in Greek mythology. After the Olympian gods had defeated the Titans and the Giants, Gaia, or Mother Earth, coupled with Tartarus, the region of the Underworld where Zeus held the Titans imprisoned, and they had Typhon, the scariest monster the world had ever seen. Typhon had a hundred dragon\'s heads, with fire blazing from all his eyes. Gaia sent Typhon to defeat the gods. Pan was the first to see him coming.\nHe alerted the other gods and then transformed himself into a goat-fish and jumped into the river Euphrates to escape the monster. The goat-fish is represented by the constellation Capricornus.\nThe goddess Aphrodite and her son Eros called to the water nymphs for help and jumped into the river. In one version of the legend, two fishes came to the rescue and carry Aphrodite and Eros on their backs to safety. In another version, the mother and son were themselves transformed into fish.');

Spirit lasted six years, roving across 4.8 miles (7.7 kilometers) of Martian terrain. But Opportunity endured some 15 years, snaring a record in 2014 for the farthest-driven vehicle on another world. By the time she fell silent, she had over 28 miles (45 km) on her odometer. And between them, this intrepid duo snapped more than 341,000 photographs. Targeting opposite hemispheres of the Red Planet, Spirit headed for the 103-mile-wide (166 km) Gusev Crater, likely formed by an asteroid impact 3.5 billion years ago and possibly the site of an ancient lake. Opportunity took aim at Meridiani Planum, a broad plain with strong chemical signatures of a wet, watery past. Together, they sought clues to Mars’ past environment and whether this modern-day cold, dry desert had ever been conducive to life. Laden with cameras, spectrometers, a rock abrasion tool for direct sampling, and their own wheels to help dig exploratory trenches in the martian dirt, the solar-powered twins were tasked with hunting minerals left behind by water-driven processes. They would also trace the geological mechanisms that shaped Mars’ now-arid landscape. Each rover weighed 408 pounds (185 kilograms), stood 5.1 feet (1.5 m) tall, and was 7.5 feet (2.3 m) wide and 5.2 feet (1.6 m) long. They inched their way across the ubiquitous red regolith at a snail’s pace, averaging just 0.02 mph (0.03 km/h).'),('Aurorae throughout our solar system and beyond','\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spectacular auroral emissions reveal just how interconnected stars, planets, and moons really are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astronomy.com/author/theo-nicitopoulos/&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot; title=&quot;Posts by Theo Nicitopoulos&quot;&gt;Theo Nicitopoulos&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;Published: April 28, 2023&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Astronaut Thomas Pesquet of SpaceX&amp;#39;s Crew-2 mission captured this stunning shot of an aurora over North American Nov. 4, 2021. This particularly strong aurora was the result of an X-class solar flare erupting from the Sun. ESA/NASA/T. Pesquet&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both inside and outside the solar system, aurorae light up the skies of planets, moons, and a variety of other celestial objects. With their emissions ranging from X-ray to radio wavelengths, aurorae are a signpost for the myriad interactions that can produce them &amp;mdash; interactions that would otherwise be difficult to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes aurorae on Earth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, the Sun&amp;rsquo;s solar wind, which is packed with charged particles, washes over Earth and our protective magnetic shield, the magnetosphere. But this steady breeze of charged particles drags Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field lines across the poles, giving our magnetosphere a comet-like tail that extends into the shadowy space beyond Earth&amp;rsquo;s nightside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The magnetotail is like a cooker that accelerates electrons from Earth&amp;rsquo;s space and dumps them into the polar regions,&amp;rdquo; Eftyhia Zesta, a space physicist at NASA&amp;rsquo;s Goddard Space Flight Center, tells&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Astronomy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The electrons, in turn, collide with atmospheric particles and impart enough energy to bump them up to a higher-energy state. These excited atmospheric particles then emit photons of visible light when they return to their original energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.astronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/Earthsmagnetosphere.jpg?w=600&amp;amp;resize=600%2C337&quot; style=&quot;height:337px; width:600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field creates a protective magnetosphere around the planet. Occasionally, if the Sun ejects a powerful coronal mass ejection toward Earth, our planet&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field lines can channel some of that energy. NASA/GSFC-Conceptual Image Lab/Walt Feimer (HTSI)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The well-known green aurorae occur when electrons collide with oxygen particles at altitudes between about 62 miles (100 kilometers) and 186 miles (300 km). The rarer red aurorae are the result of electron-oxygen collisions higher up in Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, at altitudes between about 186 miles (300 km) and 248 miles (400 km). Meanwhile the purplish-pink-red fringes of aurorae are the work of electron-nitrogen impacts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And because the billions of intermittent flashes of light that combine to create an aurora happen along magnetic field lines that are constantly moving, auroral bands have the appearance of &amp;ldquo;dancing&amp;rdquo; across the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earth&amp;rsquo;s aurorae are not just a night-time phenomenon, either: On Earth&amp;rsquo;s dayside, protons in the magnetosphere collide with atmospheric hydrogen atoms and emit X-rays. Unfortunately, our eyes haven&amp;rsquo;t evolved to view X-ray light, so these daytime aurorae are invisible to us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Aurorae are not always visible, but they are still a type of light,&amp;rdquo; Zesta says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.astronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/AuroraecolorsEarth.jpg?w=600&amp;amp;resize=600%2C436&quot; style=&quot;height:436px; width:600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As charged particles slam into atoms in Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, it excites the atmospheric atoms, which then emit light when they settle back down to their regular state. The color of light emitted depends on what elements the atmospheric molecules are made of. NASA&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The northern and southern lights of Earth are not the only aurorae in the solar system. A variety of mechanisms cause aurorae elsewhere. In some cases, the mechanisms that create aurorae on other worlds are similar to what happens at Earth. And in other case, they are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Aurorae on Mercury? No, but&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite having a global magnetic field, Mercury&amp;rsquo;s field is just 1 percent the strength of Earth&amp;rsquo;s.The solar system&amp;rsquo;s innermost planet also has an extremely thin atmosphere, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the right requirements to produce aurorae.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.astronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/Mercurysodiumtail.jpg?w=600&amp;amp;resize=600%2C243&quot; style=&quot;height:243px; width:600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Left: Astrophotography Andrea Alessandrini captured this image of Mercury&amp;rsquo;s sodium tail as its brightness was peaking on May 13, 2021, through a 2.5-inch refractor.

Left: Andrea Alessandrin; Right: Paul Robinson&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, some of the solar wind does seep into Mercury&amp;rsquo;s magnetosphere, where it is accelerated downward and collides with the planet&amp;rsquo;s surface, ejecting rocky material (largely sodium) that glows in the sunlight. Some astrophotographers have even managed to capture images of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://astronomy.com/magazine/stephen-omeara/2021/10/catching-mercury-by-the-tail&quot;&gt;Mercury&amp;rsquo;s tenous sodium tail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not aurorae, but it&amp;rsquo;s a similar process,&amp;rdquo; says Carl Schmidt, a space physicist at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Aurorae on Venus? Yes, but&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Venus has no significant global magnetic field, which means the solar wind collides directly with particles in Venus&amp;rsquo; atmosphere, like carbon dioxide and oxygen. This does produce aurorae on Venus, but not in quite the same way aurorae are produced on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.astronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/AuroraeonVenus.jpg?w=600&amp;amp;resize=600%2C450&quot; style=&quot;height:450px; width:600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because Venus is relatively close to the Sun, the solar wind it experiences is much more intense. C. Carreau/ESA&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aurorae on Venus display themselves as faint flashes of ultraviolet and visible light, including the same green emissions seen on Earth&amp;rsquo;s nightside, which indicates the presence of excited oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Aurorae on Mars? Yes, but&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Red Planet also displays aurorae, despite the world not having a global magnetic field. But Mars does have localized magnetospheres in its southern hemisphere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These zones are produced by ancient rocks that have remained magnetic from long ago, when Mars had a dipole magnetic field. Oxygen emissions like those seen on Earth and Venus suggest that green aurorae could be visible to future astronauts who visit Mars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.astronomy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/Marsaurora.jpg?w=600&amp;amp;resize=600%2C450&quot; style=&quot;height:450px; width:600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The MAVEN spacecraft&amp;rsquo;s Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) detected auroral emissions above the northern hemisphere of Mars in December 2014, as seen in this artist&amp;rsquo;s illustration. University of Colorado&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not all: Mars also has dayside proton aurorae that occur when solar wind protons accelerate hydrogen particles to the lower atmosphere, where they collide with other particles. Beyond the solar wind, energetic protons and electrons from solar flares also produce diffuse aurorae at mid latitudes on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Aurorae on Jupiter? Yes.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of all the aurorae in the solar system, none are more powerful than Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s. The gas giant&amp;rsquo;s massive size and fast rotation produce a magnetosphere some 20,000 times as powerful as Earth&amp;rsquo;s. Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s magnetosphere accelerates electrons deep into the gas giant&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. These electrons then collide with particles like hydrogen to produce Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s vast northern and southern auroral lights, which shimmer in a red tone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s aurorae are not only huge, they also never stop. &amp;ldquo;If you could turn off the solar wind, Earth would not have an aurora, but Jupiter would,&amp;rdquo; says Schmidt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://astronomy.com/sitefiles/resources/image.aspx?item=%7BF010270F-062F-4A9C-862C-368BE38E372C%7D&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jupiteraurora&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/astronomy.com/-/media/Images/News%20and%20Observing/News/2023/04/Jupiteraurora.jpg?w=620&amp;amp;ssl=1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hubble Space Telescopes captured far-ultraviolet observations of strong aurorae on the poles of Jupiter, seen in this composite shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NASA/ESA/J.

Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s aurorae also have been observed in ultraviolet, infrared, and visible light on the nightside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s not all. Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s magnetosphere accelerates electrons and protons into the atmospheres of its moons, where they collide with gases like oxygen (Europa and Callisto) and sulfur dioxide and salts (Io). This produces a spectacular range of colors, including red, green, orange, and a mix of hues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Aurorae on Saturn? Yes.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturn&amp;rsquo;s main auroral ovals appear over the planet&amp;rsquo;s polar regions. These aurorae are thought to be both solar wind-driven like on Earth, and magnetosphere-driven like on Jupiter.

There&amp;rsquo;s an assumed inner edge as well at about 6,500 light-years from the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s core. The relatively large numbers of supernovas occurring there would expose any planets in the region to intense ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, making it difficult for life to last for long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This detection, together with previous detections of organic molecules at similar large distances from the galactic center, supports the idea that the outer boundaries of the galactic habitable zone could be wider than what we previously thought,&amp;rdquo; Fontani says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For life to emerge so far from the galaxy&amp;rsquo;s center, planets would need to exist out there.

The yellow dot marks the position of the sun.JPL-CALTECH/NASA, R. HURT/SSC/CALTECH, L. KOELEMAY, C. CHANGBecause astronomers had not found the six life-essential elements so far from the galactic center, they assumed the region where life could exist in the Milky Way — what’s called the galactic habitable zone — extended at most to the farthest supernova they’d found, about 52,000 light years from the galactic center. There’s an assumed inner edge as well at about 6,500 light-years from the galaxy’s core. The relatively large numbers of supernovas occurring there would expose any planets in the region to intense ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, making it difficult for life to last for long.“This detection, together with previous detections of organic molecules at similar large distances from the galactic center, supports the idea that the outer boundaries of the galactic habitable zone could be wider than what we previously thought,” Fontani says.For life to emerge so far from the galaxy’s center, planets would need to exist out there. So far, they have been observed only relatively close to the solar system — most within a few thousand light-years. “I don’t think we know right now whether they can form at larger galactic-central distances,” Ziurys says. Finding the six elements for life at the galaxy’s edge, she says, will hopefully spur on the search for the most distant places where it could thrive.'),('Newborn stars sculpt their galaxies in new James Webb telescope images','\n\n&lt;p&gt;JWST&amp;rsquo;s sharp infrared eyes reveal stunning new details invisible to previous observatories&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/author/lisa-grossman&quot;&gt;Lisa Grossman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MARCH 8, 2023 AT 8:00 AM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A gaggle of galaxies crackle with intricate detail in new images from the James Webb Space Telescope.

After decades of searching, they aren&amp;rsquo;t getting any younger. And they still haven&amp;rsquo;t found what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, the object of the physicists&amp;rsquo; quest is SUSY. SUSY is not a real person or even a fountain relevant to aging in any way. It&amp;rsquo;s a mathematical framework based on principles of symmetry that could help physicists better explain the mysteries of the universe. Many experts believe that particles predicted by SUSY are the weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, that supposedly make up the invisible &amp;ldquo;dark matter&amp;rdquo; lurking throughout the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So far, though, SUSY has been something of a disappointment. Despite multiple heroic searches, SUSY has remained concealed from view. Maybe it is a mathematical mirage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If SUSY does turn out to be a myth, it won&amp;rsquo;t be the first time that symmetry has led science on a wild WIMP chase. Reasoning from the symmetry of circular motion originally suggested the existence of a new form of matter out in space more than two millennia ago. Devotion to that symmetry blinded science to the true nature of the solar system and planetary motion for the next 19 centuries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can blame Plato and Aristotle. In their day, ordinary matter supposedly consisted of four elements: earth, air, fire and water. Aristotle built an elaborate theory of motion based on those elements. He insisted that they naturally moved in straight lines; earth and water moving straight down (toward the center of the world), air and fire moving straight up. In the heavens, though, Aristotle noticed that motion appeared to be circular, as the stars rotated around the nighttime sky. &amp;ldquo;Our eyes tell us that the heavens revolve in a circle,&amp;rdquo; he wrote in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.1.i.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;On the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. Since the known four elements all moved in a straight line, Aristotle deduced that the heavens must consist of a fifth element, called aether &amp;mdash; absent on Earth but predominant in space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plato, on theoretical rather than observational grounds, had already insisted that circularity&amp;rsquo;s symmetry signified perfection, and therefore circular motion should be required in the heavens. And so for centuries, the assumption that celestial motion must be circular held a stranglehold on natural philosophers attempting to understand of the universe. As late as the 16th century, Copernicus was willing to depose Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Earth from the middle of everything but still believed that the Earth and other planets revolved around the sun with a combination of circular motions. Another half century passed before Kepler established that planetary orbits are elliptical, not circular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s belief in an exotic form of matter in space is not so different from the picture scientists paint of the heavens today, albeit in a rather more rigorous and sophisticated theoretical way. Dark matter predominates in space, astronomers believe; it is inferred to exist from gravitational effects altering the motions of stars and galaxies. And physicists have determined that the dark matter cannot (for various noncircular reasons) be made of the same ordinary matter found on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SUSY particles have long been one of the most popular proposals for the identity of this cosmic dark matter, based on more complicated notions of symmetry than those available to Plato and Aristotle. And since the onset of the 20th century, symmetry math has generated an astounding string of scientific successes. From Einstein&amp;rsquo;s relativity to the theory of elementary particles and forces, symmetry considerations now form the core of science&amp;rsquo;s understanding of nature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These mathematical forms of symmetry are more elaborate examples of symmetry as commonly understood: a change that leaves things looking like they did before. A perfectly symmetric face looks the same when a mirror swaps left with right. A perfect sphere&amp;rsquo;s appearance is not altered when you rotate it to see the other side. Rotate a snowflake by any multiple of 60 degrees and you see the same snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, more sophisticated mathematical frameworks, known as symmetry groups, describe aspects of the physical world, such as time and space or the families of subatomic particles that make up matter or transmit forces. Symmetries in the equations of such math can even predict previously unknown phenomena. Symmetry in the equations describing subatomic particles, for instance, revealed that for each particle nature allowed an antimatter particle, with opposite electric charge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, all the known ordinary matter and force particles fit neatly into the mathematical patterns described by symmetry groups. But none of those particles can explain the dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SUSY particles as a dark matter possibility emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, when theorists proposed an even more advanced symmetry system. That math, called supersymmetry (hence SUSY), suggested the existence of a &amp;ldquo;super&amp;rdquo; partner particle for each known particle: a force-particle partner for every matter particle, and a matter-particle partner for every force particle. It was an elegant concept mathematically, and it solved (or at least ameliorated) some other vexing theoretical problems. Plus, of the super partner particles it predicted, the lightest one (whichever one that was) seemed likely to be a perfect dark matter WIMP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alas, efforts to detect WIMPs (which should be hitting the Earth all the time) have almost all failed to find any.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://people.roma2.infn.it/~dama/web/home.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One experiment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that did claim a WIMP detection seems to be on shaky ground &amp;mdash; a new experiment, using the same method and materials,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01175&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reports no such WIMP evidence&lt;/a&gt;. And attempts to produce SUSY particles in the world&amp;rsquo;s most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, have also come up empty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some physicists have therefore given up on SUSY. And perhaps supersymmetry has been as misleading as the Greek infatuation with circular motion. But the truth is that SUSY is not a theory that can be slain by a single experiment. It is a more nebulous mathematical notion, a framework within which many specific theories can be constructed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t really kill SUSY because it&amp;rsquo;s not a thing,&amp;rdquo; physicist Patrick Stengel of the International Higher School of Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, said at a conference in Washington, D.C., in 2019. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not an idea that you can kill. It&amp;rsquo;s basically just a framework for a bunch of ideas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the same conference, University of Texas at Austin physicist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ph.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/18-physics/4028-freese-katherine?Itemid=1264&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Katherine Freese&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;pointed out that there was never any guarantee that the Large Hadron Collider would discover SUSY. &amp;ldquo;Even before the LHC got built, there were a lot of people who said, well, it might not go to a high enough energy,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So SUSY may yet turn out to be an example of symmetry that leads physics to success. But just in case, physicists have pursued other dark matter possibilities. One old suggestion that has recently received renewed interest is a lightweight hypothetical particle&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particles-axions-how-matter-conquered-universe&quot;&gt;called an axion&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;SN: 3/24/20&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, if axions do exist, symmetry fans could still rejoice &amp;mdash; the motivation for proposing the axion to begin with was resolving an issue&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/the-other-dark-matter-candidate&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;with yet another form of symmetry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;','storage/imgtitle/032921_to_supersymmetry-column_feat-1030x580.jpg','If dark matter WIMPs are mythical, they join the ancient idea that the planets moved in circlesSecond of two partsPhysicists have a lot in common with Ponce de León and U2’s Bono.

Plus, of the super partner particles it predicted, the lightest one (whichever one that was) seemed likely to be a perfect dark matter WIMP.Alas, efforts to detect WIMPs (which should be hitting the Earth all the time) have almost all failed to find any. One experiment that did claim a WIMP detection seems to be on shaky ground — a new experiment, using the same method and materials, reports no such WIMP evidence. And attempts to produce SUSY particles in the world’s most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, have also come up empty.Some physicists have therefore given up on SUSY. And perhaps supersymmetry has been as misleading as the Greek infatuation with circular motion. But the truth is that SUSY is not a theory that can be slain by a single experiment. It is a more nebulous mathematical notion, a framework within which many specific theories can be constructed.   “You can’t really kill SUSY because it’s not a thing,” physicist Patrick Stengel of the International Higher School of Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, said at a conference in Washington, D.C., in 2019. “It’s not an idea that you can kill. It’s basically just a framework for a bunch of ideas.”At the same conference, University of Texas at Austin physicist Katherine Freese pointed out that there was never any guarantee that the Large Hadron Collider would discover SUSY. “Even before the LHC got built, there were a lot of people who said, well, it might not go to a high enough energy,” she said.So SUSY may yet turn out to be an example of symmetry that leads physics to success. But just in case, physicists have pursued other dark matter possibilities. One old suggestion that has recently received renewed interest is a lightweight hypothetical particle called an axion (SN: 3/24/20).Of course, if axions do exist, symmetry fans could still rejoice — the motivation for proposing the axion to begin with was resolving an issue with yet another form of symmetry.');
